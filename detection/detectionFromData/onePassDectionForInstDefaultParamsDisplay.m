% Quick way to run a grasp search over an image. Runs a search for a
% default set of search parameters, loading some other necessary variables.
% 
% Visualizes the search as it runs. Shows the current rectangle (red/blue)
% and the top-ranked rectangle (yellow/green)
% 
% Takes the instance number to search for, the directory that the grasping
% data is in, and the directory that the background images are in.
%
% Assumes that the scripts in recTraining have been used to learn a set of
% weights, which are stored in ../weights
% 
% Arguments:
% instNum: instance number to do detection on
% dataDir: directory containing the grasping dataset cases (should have a
%          lot of pcd* files)
% bgDir: directory containing the dataset background files (pdcb*)
